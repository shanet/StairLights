StairLights is an Arduino-based LED stair way lighting project. It uses an Arduino, two IR transmitters, two IR recievers, and a strand of individually controllable LEDs to display light patterns on stairs when a person is walking up or down them.

Demo of it in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21KKr8hQo5A

## Parts

* Arduino Uno R3 (http://www.adafruit.com/products/50)
* Adafruit 36mm 12V LEDs (http://www.adafruit.com/products/683)
* 12V 5A power supply for the LEDs (https://www.adafruit.com/products/352)
* 2.1mm barallel plug adapter (https://www.adafruit.com/products/368)
* Two IR transmitters (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10732)
* Two IR receivers (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266)
* About 150ft of 22 AWG hook-up wire (https://www.adafruit.com/products/290)

## Installation

A circuit diagram is provided as a png and a Fritzing file. Missing from the diagram is the external power supply connected to the LED strand.

Once everything is wired up, load the sketch on the Arduino like any other sketch.
